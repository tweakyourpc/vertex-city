/**
 * The cartographic generalization layer.
 *
 * OSM (and the procedural world) hand the renderer *facts*: this cell is a
 * road, this is grass, this polygon is water. The renderer decides how those
 * facts become ASCII. That separation is what lets the city stay truthful about
 * what is on the ground while taking full artistic liberty over how it reads.
 *
 * Every ground surface type maps to a small vocabulary here: a glyph family and
 * a base colour, each expressed per perceptual tier (near / mid / far) so the
 * same truthful object can collapse gracefully as it recedes — a crosswalk that
 * is `####` up close becomes `==` then `--` far away, without ever lying about
 * what it is.
 *
 * This module is the single source of that vocabulary. `materials.js` and the
 * raycaster consult it; nothing downstream hard-codes a ground glyph anymore.
 *
 * The tier is chosen by `surfaceTier` from the view distance, the angle the
 * surface is seen at, and the time of day. Today the ground renderer pins the
 * 'mid' tier so output is unchanged; flipping it to `surfaceTier(...)` is the
 * one-line switch that turns the LOD on (see groundGlyph / groundColour below).

/**
 * Map a viewing situation to a surface detail tier.
 *
 * Mirrors the facade renderer's near/mid/far split (raycaster.js rowsPerFloor):
 * up close a surface earns its full texture, at mid range a coarser reading,
 * and far away it collapses to a stable speckle. The inputs are deliberately the
 * same quantities the rest of the renderer already has:
 *
 *   d        perpendicular distance in cells (the floor cast's dPerp)
 *   viewAngle cosine of the angle between the view ray and the surface normal
 *             (1 = straight down, 0 = grazing). Grazing views lose detail first,
 *             exactly like a wall seen edge-on.
 *   dayAmt   0 night .. 1 day, from Lighting. Lit detail matters less by day.
 *
 * Returns one of 'near' | 'mid' | 'far'.
