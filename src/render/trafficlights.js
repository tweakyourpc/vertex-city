/**
 * Traffic signals at intersections.
 *
 * Every place two or more named streets meet (world.junctions) gets one signal
 * head per approach, mounted on the near-right corner of the crossing so the
 * four heads sit at the four corners instead of piling up in the middle. Each
 * head is a narrow 2-wide column of three lamps — red, amber, green — drawn
 * with the full-block glyph `█` so they read as solid lights in every render
 * mode (glyph mode paints the character; block/cinematic modes paint the cell
 * as a solid block). Exactly one lamp is lit at a time, cycling on a realistic
 * four-phase beat: green holds, amber warns, red holds, then straight back to
 * green. The amber phase is the transition in BOTH directions — it gives
 * traffic time to clear on green→red, and a brief all-stop before red→green —
 * which is how a real signal behaves. Each junction is offset so the city does
 * not blink in unison, and the head glows brighter after dark.
 *
 * The head is projected to the screen at a real world size and distance, so it
 * shrinks with distance like any other object, and it is depth-tested against
 * the scene buffer so a building in front of a junction hides it — the same
 * occlusion rule the streets and signs obey.
